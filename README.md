# ImgurUserTools
Tools for Imgur users by Imgur users.

ImgurCustomNav.js
- Allows users to set up their own keyboard navigation binds. Currently only has binds for A and D.

ImgurExportDescriptions.js
- Allows users to create a text file containing the descriptions of a gallery post.
- Creates 1 file. Might need more work for long posts with numerous images.

ImgurExportMessages.js
- Allows users to create a text file containing the messages they have had with other users.
- Creates 1 file per conversation at a time. Would need more work to be able to loop through all conversations.

ImgurMassUnfavorite.js
- INCOMPLETE: This does NOT Unfavorite any posts. To do so requires more work. This is just ground work for a feature.
- This was built upon the idea of being able to mass Unfavorite posts. Somebody created a way to loop through every Favorited post but it would Unfavorite everything.
- Instead of Unfavoriting everything, this allows users to select individual posts from their Favorites, saving the selection to local storage to be Unfavorited later.
